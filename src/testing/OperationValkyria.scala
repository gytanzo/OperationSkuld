    "What the el did you just fucking psy about me, you little congroo? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in Hacking 101, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on SERN, and I have over 300 confirmed exploits. I am trained in gorilla coding and I’m the top scientist in the entire Future Gadget Laboratory. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before in Akihabara, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Steins Gate? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across several timelines and your divergence value is being traced right now so you better prepare for the time traveller, maggot. The time traveller that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my gel banana. Not only am I extensively trained in time travel, but I have access to the my entire arsenal as a mad scientist and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face ofJapan, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held to your fucking D-mail. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. This is the choice of Steins;Gate, kiddo."
